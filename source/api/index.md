Welcome to the RightBTC API documentation.
The RightBTC APIs are designed to allow access to all of the features of the RightBTC platform, subject to you complying with the API Terms of Service.

## API access

In order to access the parts of the API which require authentication, you must generate an API key and an API secret using web page of account info.

You can generate as many API keys as you would like(**Entity Account Required**), and each of those keys can be customised in a few ways.

|  PERMISSIONS | Read | Write |
|  ------- | -------| ------- |
|  ORDERS   |  √  | √ | 
|  ORDER_HISTROY   |  √  | √ | 
|  FEE |  √  | × | 
|  DEPOSITS |  ×  | × | 
|  WITHDRAWS |  ×  | × | 

## Notes

* Do not parse text descriptions, use only codes
* All times are UTC timestamps expressed as micro-seconds (eg 1571234567000), but candlestick API calls using seconds(eg 1571234567).

## Precisions

{% note info Lots/Ticks %}
Due to precisions of floating-point issue in computer is not 100% real,
So we are using lots/ticks to replace price/amount.
The precision level of all trading is calculated based on significant integers(lots/ticks).
{% endnote %}

Let's see case of:

Now Bitcoin's price is $9000.00, then I want to BUY 0.1 BTC on rightbtc.

|  PAIR | In float price/amount | In rightbc lots/ticks |
|  ------- | -------| ------- |
|  BTCUSD |  9000.00/0.1  | 900000/100000 |

`price 9000.00` => `ticks 900000` ? because rightbtc defines `1 tick` = `0.01 USD`
`amount 0.1` => `lots 100000` ? because rightbtc defines `1 lot` = `0.000001 BTC`

Now we also know what is minimum amount and tick of price of one pair in rightbtc.

See API [Contracts](https://api.rightbc.com/v1/contracts) to get each defination of trading pairs.

## REST APIs

### General
```
https://api.rightbtc.com/v1
```
Requests parameters for POST requests (authenticated) in the "Authenticated Enpoints" section, not GET parameters.

Requests parameters for GET requests (non-authenticated) are based on URI,

In order to offer the best service possible we have added a rate limit to the number of REST requests.

|  METHOD | per second | per minute | per day |
|  ------- | -------| ------- | ------- |
|  REQUESTS | - | 1200 | - |
|  ORDERS |  10 | - | 100000 |


### Public Endpoints

All Public Endpoints use GET requests.

Let's try `GET /v1/markets`:
``` bash
$ curl --location --request GET "http://api.rightbtc.com/v1/markets"
```
```json
[
    {
        "mnem": "BTCUSD",
        "display": "display",
        "contr": "BTCUSD",
        "settlDate": null,
        "expiryDate": null,
        "state": 1,
        "makerFee": 0,
        "takerFee": 0
    },
    {
        "mnem": "ETPBTC",
        "display": "display",
        "contr": "ETPBTC",
        "settlDate": null,
        "expiryDate": null,
        "state": 1,
        "makerFee": 0,
        "takerFee": 0
    }
]
```

### Authenticated Endpoints

All Authenticated Endpoints use POST requests.
Authentication is done using an API key and a secret.
To generate this pair, please go to the API Access web page.

The authentication procedure is as follows:

1. Get your `apiKey` and `secretKey` pair from web page.
截图1

2. Prepare HTTP Header with
```
* APIKEY: apiKey
* NONCE: nonce - a strictly increasing number (eg:timestamp)
* SIGNATURE: MD5(body + secretKey + nonce)
```
The `body` is content of POST request which is **JSON encoded**.

```cpp
string apiKey = config.getApiKey();
string secretKey = config.getSecretKey();
string nonce = getTimeOfDay();

httpHeader.insert("APIKEY", apiKey);
httpHeader.insert("NONCE", nonce);

string jsonEncodedBody = "{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}";
string payload = jsonEncodedBody + secretKey + nonce;
string signature = crypto::md5(payload);

httpHeader.insert("SIGNATURE", signature);
```

Specifically, Content Type supports `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
Add below in Header please,
```
* content-type:application/json
```
*Parsing JSON on rightbtc is faster than x-www-form-urlencoded*
